- Soldered the TB6612FNG motor driver to the controller board.
- Assembled both motors' wiring looms
- Assembled wiring for the controller power supply (motors' power supply)
- Created a motor driver (motor.cpp, motor.h)

Temporarily soldered some wires to the TB6612FNG so it can be driven from
a breadboard. It's all ready so the controller can be connected to a testing
power source and the Arduino Nano, using the motor driver code, drive the
two motors. Tomorrow

Tested Arduino Nano connected to an AS5600 encoder, successfully returning
numbers on the serial port. More physical tests will be run later on the robot
itself as it is hard to centre the magnet by hand for 'just a test'.

This also served to test the whole Arduino development environment successfully.

After doing some thinking, I've decided to downgrade from an ESP32 to an
Arduino Nano dev board. Initially I envisioned a single ESP32 controller handling
motion, power, and possibly a limb. It was also an opportunity to work with
FreeRTOS and use C++. Having moved its development environment to the Raspberry Pi
made me see how big it is (north of 3GB and really slow to compile).

In contrast, the Arduino Nano board will be able to handle the simple task of
motion, using a less sizable environment and still allowing me to code in C++,
which is not a deal breaker, but it's good exercise.

This change involves including an I2c multiplexer, since the two AS5600 rotary
encoders I have, can't have their I2c bus addresses reconfigured and will collide.

Added the slightly updated design for the body, this time using FreeCAD, which
will become the main 3D parts design tool. OpenSCAD has a nice programmer's appeal
by designing with code, but FreeCAD, while being a more traditional CAD tool,
allows for parametric designs and faster development, and it's free software.

I will continue to consider OpenSCAD + LibreCAD wherever they seem to make sense.

Pushed the current state of the project to Github.
Cleaned up the README.md to be more concise. This development log will keep
track of the changes made, with long descriptions that usually won't fit in
a commit's message. Although that can be done on github's pull requests
forms, I prefer to keep its history self-contained.

Designed (hand drawing) a PCB layout for the motor driver, PCB connectors to the
motors and their power supply, based on a perfboard. Started the process by
soldering the TB6612FNG and associated tracks to the board. The ESP32 board's
layout on the PCB is still to be assessed, until I decide what sensors I'll be
using, and where I will place them.

Designed a new chasis for the ratbot. This will undergo some upgrades depending
on the needs of the project. The holes for the wheel/motor bracket holding points
will need reinforcements.

As the previous entry, test printed the magnet holders for the encoders and
they were too tight (not big enough to even fit). There's a rough 0.3mm difference
between design and actual print when it comes to holes. The design was modified
and now the key fitted tightly but the magnet cavity ended up being slightly loose.

Wedging some plastic reject material from previous prints between the part and the
magnet made it stay firm.

After a test print, realised that I've calculated the standoffs for the
encoder PCB to be too tall. Also noticed that some holes for screws would
be too small. The corrected design works well.

Created a fitting for the wheel encoder magnets. The encoder manufacturer
recommends a clearance of 0.5mm ~ 3.0mm between the magnet and the chip. I
will amend the height of the encoder support so it falls around 1.5mm.

First log entry. At this stage, a few parts of the robot have been initiated which
are not recorded in this log.

Today found a neat way of combining LibreCAD and OpenSCAD to use a compromise of
traditional CAD and the goodness of parametric design in code. I've created a
support for the motors that drive the wheels, and included anchor points for
the rotary encoder used with each motor. Measurements are subject to change
until I have the required magnets at hand for measurement.
