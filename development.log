First log entry. At this stage, a few parts of the robot have been initiated which
are not recorded in this log.

Today found a neat way of combining LibreCAD and OpenSCAD to use a compromise of
traditional CAD and the goodness of parametric design in code. I've created a
support for the motors that drive the wheels, and included anchor points for
the rotary encoder used with each motor. Measurements are subject to change
until I have the required magnets at hand for measurement.
