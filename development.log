Designed a new chasis for the ratbot. This will undergo some upgrades depending
on the needs of the project. The holes for the wheel/motor bracket holding points
will need reinforcements.

As the previous entry, test printed the magnet holders for the encoders and
they were too tight (not big enough to even fit). There's a rough 0.3mm difference
between design and actual print when it comes to holes. The design was modified
and now the key fitted tightly but the magnet cavity ended up being slightly loose.

Wedging some plastic reject material from previous prints between the part and the
magnet made it stay firm.

After a test print, realised that I've calculated the standoffs for the
encoder PCB to be too tall. Also noticed that some holes for screws would
be too small. The corrected design works well.

Created a fitting for the wheel encoder magnets. The encoder manufacturer
recommends a clearance of 0.5mm ~ 3.0mm between the magnet and the chip. I
will amend the height of the encoder support so it falls around 1.5mm.

First log entry. At this stage, a few parts of the robot have been initiated which
are not recorded in this log.

Today found a neat way of combining LibreCAD and OpenSCAD to use a compromise of
traditional CAD and the goodness of parametric design in code. I've created a
support for the motors that drive the wheels, and included anchor points for
the rotary encoder used with each motor. Measurements are subject to change
until I have the required magnets at hand for measurement.
